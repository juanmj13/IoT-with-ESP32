# IoT with ESP32

This repository will showcase various IoT projects using the ESP32 microcontroller. I will be adding different projects and examples that demonstrate the versatility of the ESP32 in various IoT applications.

## Example Projects:

- **Smart Home System**: A simple home automation project to control lights and appliances using the ESP32.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: A sensor-based system that measures temperature and humidity and sends the data to a cloud platform.
- **LoRa-based Communication System**: An IoT project that uses LoRa technology for long-range communication between ESP32 devices.
- **Bluetooth-based Proximity Detector**: A project to detect the presence of Bluetooth-enabled devices in a defined range using ESP32's BLE functionality.
- **Wi-Fi Based Web Server**: Create a simple web server on the ESP32 to control devices or view sensor data remotely via a browser.
- **Voice-Controlled IoT System**: Integrating voice recognition for controlling IoT devices using the ESP32.

Stay tuned for more exciting projects to be added!
